# Dropbash
========

A simple, fully synced shell environment for designers and front-enders working in OSX. To get mo' better useful things done more easily with less typing. In the terminal.

I'm starting with a skeleton of my personal favorites, minus the server and framework specific things that wouldn't make sense for others. I'll add to it over time. You could too.

Setup instructions are located in the top of .drop_bash
